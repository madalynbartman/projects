Study analysis

an analysis of how long it takes me to learn skills

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
my performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
O = skill 1, A = skill 2, V = skill 3, SA = the best thing i learned at buckley/in the navy, J = java

may20, 2019 - aug8, 2019 | O

Aug-Nov but really was Feb |A

Feb-apr did nothing i think

Qualified V in jul so apr-jul | V

good at SA by Nov | SA

may-nov 12 hour shifts 3 to 4 days a week of dedicated analysis 26 weeks 13 weeks of 36 hours (468) and 13 weeks of 48 hours (624) = 1092 hours | SA

forgot school, which was 6 hours 5 days a week for 5 months. That was 800 hours of practice before even getting started.

started java in august early august or was it july 30th or 31st? 15 weeks till i was able to write original scripts off the cuff (600) hours at work and 46 hours at home (646 total) till i could stand on my own | J

Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
10000 hours to be an expert and 1092 to be a journeyman? expert in 5 years. then maybe senior is at 5000 hours? senior as in do well as a scrum lead. that'd be 2 1/2 years. expert would be something like architect. if thats all it takes to become an expert, why do so few people become an architect or expert?

that means in another 446 hours i should be a jouneryman (counter starts the week of 11/13 at work and at 46 hours on productivity challenger. only use productivity challneger on work days if you've already done 8 hours of work obviously. then it counts as after hours practice)

it would take 11.15 weeks of 5 8 hour days. if i add in 3 or 4 12 hour days then itd take (as in 12 or 16 etra hours a week. the median is 14 hours which is a 54 hours a week) at would know it down to 8.26 weeks

all that extra effort of only 3 weeks

what days are min and min alone? Monday, Tues, Thursday, Saturday - minus time spent gaming with my brother if it happens so saturday is iffy

should add the 4 hour study sessions to these days

if 50 work weeks in a year then expert in 5 years start to finish. I started java be dev 31JUL23 this would mean architect by 01AUG28. That's quite an audacious goal. Why? What makes the difference between hours spent and mastery? Is it focus, appplication of effort, and thorough compreshion? Is it competition with others? Is it the combo of accademic knowledge and practical knowledge (analogoy)? Do most not bother maintaining the former after the junior stage ends?

Novie (ends with off the cuff code and projects) 0-26/46/55 hours of solo study?
Apprentice (ends with autonomy) 0-646 (is this really 1892?)
Journeyman (ends with thorough compreshion) 646-5000
Senior (ends with mastery) 5000-10000
Master (indicates large scale architectural ability)

aka

Junior Dev
Dev
Senior Dev
Architect

Goal: Reach senior level by Jan 31, 2026 become a scrum lead by second incriment of that year (approx Apr 2026).

26 hours: Original off the cuff hackerrank responses
was able to write original responses in hackerrank after 26 hours

- it took me 46 hours of individual study and ~600 hours at work with Java till I could write my own hackerrank responses. wtf
- it took me 1892 hours of SA till I was really good
- 1892 to 646 (approx 36.5% the time - but I was not good yet) to 55 (approx 8.5% the time as Java and appox 3% the time as SA - but I am not good yet. wish I knew when I was able to SA on my own before becoming good) 
- I think this means individual study is significantly better for me than learning at work

55  hours: original art
wrote my first original art in python using turtle after 55 hours of study/practice

29: hours of study till I could engineer solutions off the cuff 
- Created a target group for our new monitoring elastic cluster
