- test it and have a third party test it (for enterprise level, not home network)

pentest
- that career field has the most growth in cyber

dev/ops model of secure from the start

passphrase > password
- use sites that give you four 3-4 word characters and mispell them
- can use a kids password generator for simplier passwords too

Scammers record your voice and use it fir deep fake. Can scam you or your friends with it.

Dont need dhcp per se, can just listen to arp requests on your network 

Only thing on phone is macafee
