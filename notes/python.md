Rewview of python concepts

Int vs Float:
An int is a whole number and a float extends to some floating decimal value

Combining string and int: 
You can't cat an int to a string or add a string to an int. You can use the string  method to convert the int to a string and cat them that way.

Delcaring a function:
def func:
    blah

Calling a function:
func()

Arguments:
You can input parameters when you call a function by declaring arguments in the parenthesis that come after the function name.

OOO:
Python can be used for OOO, procedural, or functional programming.

Uses:
Python is best used for scripting and data analysis. It can also be used for front end and back end development.

Elegance and speed:
Python is pherhaps the simlplest language. In contrast, C++ is one of the most complex languages to learn but it is many times faster than python.

Machine learning:
Python is the most widely used language for machine learning due to it's extensive libraries (like numpy & pandas), portability (can run on GPUs, no VM required), and ease of use.
