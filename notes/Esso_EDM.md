Samples
File you can play on windows media player but you can import it into FL
- can get some from FL cloud too
- he has samples of snaps people got from martin garrux but he doesn't know how 

Can start by taking what other people have done and reworking it but it gets to a point where you have to come up with the melody yourself.

Can use the virtual keyboard or your own midi keyboard. Can draw notes. Right clicking them deleted the notes. Can select the notes and move them up and down in groups o you don't have to move them individually. Can drag sideways to add more notes.

Quantize like dat punk half human half robot.

They stress the importance of layering. You build the song layer by layer.

DJ:
He used to use pioneer & Dennin 

Tried Ableton live but there's not much you can do for it. He tried the trial version and it only lasted 30 days which wasnt enough time. 

He's been trying GarageBand too. He's been trying out different DAWs.

How does he work remotely with other artists?
Talk on discord
He creates the song
Sends it to them
If they like it, he writes the vocals for it
If they are very far away, he can always use telegram and discord
